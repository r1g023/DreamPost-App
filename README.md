# Dream Post social media APP

This is a social media-like-app done with React / LESS / Apollo GraphQL on the frontend, I call it DREAM POST

I created my own API (Node Express/Knex/PostgreSQL/JWT/GraphQL) on the backend that lets a user register/login> create new posts > comments > like and share to other social media apps. Check out the deployed (Railway)
 backend API for more info at the link below:

I deployed my app to both Vercel and Netlify, links below: 

Vercel:

Netlify: [https://dream-post.netlify.app/] 

Both links above are using the same API so feel free to leave me any feedback if you spot any bugs. Or, feel free to collaborate to make the app a better user experience.
