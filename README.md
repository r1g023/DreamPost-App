# Dream Post Social Media App

Welcome to Dream Post, a social media-like application built with React, Material UI, LESS, and Apollo GraphQL on the frontend.

## Overview

Dream Post allows users to create, share, and interact with posts, comments, likes, and shares just like other social media platforms. It provides a seamless user experience and offers various functionalities to engage with content.

## Backend API

To power the Dream Post app, I developed an API using Node.js with Express, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and GraphQL. This API enables users to register, login, create posts, comment on posts, like posts and comments, and share posts. You can explore the backend API in detail [here](https://github.com/r1g023/nodeExpress-graphQL).
